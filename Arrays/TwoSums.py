# TwoSums LeetCode Question
# https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

# Task: 
# Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers 
# such that they add up to target.

# Here is an example:
# nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0,1].

def twoSum(nums, target):
    return 0

def main():
    nums = [2,7,11,15]
    target = 9

    twoSum(nums, target)

main()
